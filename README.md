DAGive is an open-source dApp for charitable giving on a DAG-structured Layer-1. It supports donor-advised flows, charity allowlists, tax-friendly receipts, and micro-donations enabled by low fees and fast confirmations. Includes contracts (or WASM modules), an indexer, a Next.js front end, and CI workflows to deploy to testnet.
